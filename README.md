### Modifying Game Settings

To adjust game parameters, edit these variables in the JavaScript section:

```javascript
// Cloud spawn rate (frames between spawns)
cloudSpawnInterval = 120; // Lower = more frequent

// Character movement speed
characterSpeed = 2; // Higher = faster movement

// Damage per collision
updateHealth(health - 15); // Change 15 to adjust damage

// Bullet firing rate
firingInterval = setInterval(..., 150); // Change 150ms for fire rate
```

### Adding New Features

The game is built with modularity in mind. Key classes:
- `Cloud`: Manages cloud objects
- `Bullet`: Handles projectile physics
- `character`: Aircraft rendering and properties
